# Viage Sierpinski Triangle Demo

This a Viage implementation of the React Fiber Sierpinski demo to demostrate that Viage is fast adn small. Viage is a modern, simple and light weight framework. You can find out more about it the [Viage Website](https://schlotg.github.io/#/home)

The Viage version runs at least as fast, as the React Fiber version. But it's total size is 20kb vs React's 433Kb. The Angular version is much slower but comes in at 82kb. If you examine the amount of app specific code, it is comparable across all three frameworks. In my opinion the Viage version is the simplest of the three to author.
