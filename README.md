# Viage Sierpinski Triangle Demo

A Viage implementation of the React Fiber Sierpinski demo to demostrate the Viage is fast. Viage is a modern, simple and light weight framework. You can find out more about it [here](https://github.com/schlotg/viage)

To run the Viage version download the [index-embedded.html](https://github.com/schlotg/viage-sierpinski/blob/master/index-embedded.html) file and run it in the browser locally.

To run the React Fiber version go [here](https://claudiopro.github.io/react-fiber-vs-stack-demo/fiber.html)

To run the an Angular implementation go [here](https://gund.github.io/ng-s-triangle-demo/single/)


The Viage version runs every bit as fast, if not faster, then the React Fiber version. But it's total size is 20kb vs React's 433Kb. The Angular version is much slower but comes in at 82kb. If you examine the amount of app specific code, it is comparable across all three frameworks. In my opinion the Viage version is the simplest of the three.
